            <p>
                <a href="#Mission">Mission: Impossible</a> is a series of American action spy films based on and a
                follow-on
                from
                the television series of
                the same name created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by and stars Tom Cruise, whose
                character is
                Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and
                scored
                from
                various filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo
                Schifrin.

                Beginning in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the events of the previous TV sequel
                series)
                follow the missions of the IMF's main field team under the leadership of Hunt to stop an enemy force all
                the
                while
                preventing an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to
                the
                ensemble
                cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by
                Ving
                Rhames)
                and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films.

            <p>
                <a href="#Vanilla">Vanilla Sky</a> is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film[3]

                Eyes,
                which
                was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role from the original film. The
                film
                has
                been described as "an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp".[4]

                The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell in
                supporting
